DISCLAIMER : This project is a work and progress and I would say is about 30% done. Most the GUI 
             elements need to be reworked polished. Most of the images are placeholders as well.

             
Sorry for the lack of comments. My documentation is usually much better than this solo project.


TODO
- Implement sql database on top of local saves. 
    - Initial idea was to store only locally because user normally doesn't have internet access.
    - New idea is to have both. Store locally when no internet, upload later to db.
    
- Fix scaling ratios on font and GUI element sizes. I am developing on 2560x1440 resolution  
  and some parts look funky on a normal 1920x1080 resolution.
  
- Add changelog tracking to Inventory, customers, employees, just about anything..  
  
- Tags (hover over gui element, info text pops up) to help the user.
    - In the Customer and Employee Page, you can edit any user info by clicking on an item.
